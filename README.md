# Extra Sounds

**[Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/extrasounds)
| [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/extrasounds)**

Improve your clicks, scrolls and more with Extra Sounds.

This is an Architectury port of the Extra Sounds mod.
It contains all the features of the original mod. 

One significant change, however, is that [Cloth Config](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cloth-config)
is used to configure volume instead of the original mod's volume sliders. This also means that it is more configurable,
e.g. it is possible to disable certain features of categories such as hotbar or inventory drag sounds.

**Requirements**:
* Architectury
    * [Forge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/architectury-forge)
    * [Fabric](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/architectury-fabric)
* [Cloth Config](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cloth-config)


## Development
To add compatibility with ExtraSounds to your project, [follow the guide on the Wiki](https://github.com/stashymane/extra-sounds/wiki).

Please note that this only applies to **resource pack creators**. 
Custom sounds for mods are not implemented, and will not be implemented any time soon.
This is due to Forge's lack of an entrypoint feature like Fabric has.

It may be possible to allow this via an API, however this would not be compatible with custom sounds 
implemented for the [original Extra Sounds](https://modrinth.com/mod/extrasounds) mod by 
another Fabric mod.
